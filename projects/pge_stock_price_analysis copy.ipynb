    "### Materials and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Data Collection\n",
    "Historical Stock Prices: Collect historical stock prices of PG&E and its peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather PG&E’s financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements) for multiple years.\n",
    "Access this data through the company’s investor relations website, SEC filings, or financial databases like Bloomberg or Reuters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Data:\n",
    "Collect market indices data (e.g., S&P 500, utilities index) for benchmarking purposes.\n",
    "Get data on interest rates, inflation rates, and other macroeconomic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "News and Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract news articles, press releases, and social media sentiment related to PG&E.\n",
    "Use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze sentiment and potential impacts on stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Preprocessing Data\n",
    "Clean and Normalize Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.\n",
    "Normalize the data for consistency, especially financial ratios.\n",
    "Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create relevant financial ratios (e.g., P/E ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, EBITDA).\n",
    "Generate technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD).\n",
    "Develop sentiment scores from news and social media data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Visualize Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot stock price trends and compare with peers and market indices.\n",
    "Visualize financial ratios and their trends over time.\n",
    "Correlation Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze correlations between PG&E’s stock price and financial ratios, technical indicators, and sentiment scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Model Building\n",
    "Supervised Learning Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression Models: Use linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, and decision tree regression to predict stock prices based on financial and technical indicators.\n",
    "Classification Models: Implement models like logistic regression, SVM, and random forests to classify if the stock is undervalued (buy) or overvalued (sell).\n",
    "Time Series Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average for forecasting future stock prices.\n",
    "LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory neural networks for capturing long-term dependencies in stock price movements.\n",
    "Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use ensemble techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost for improved prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Model Evaluation\n",
    "Backtesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtest your models using historical data to evaluate their performance.\n",
    "Measure metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and accuracy for classification models.\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform cross-validation to ensure your models are not overfitting and generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Interpretation and Decision-Making\n",
    "Feature Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze feature importance to understand which factors are driving the stock price predictions.\n",
    "Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for detailed interpretation.\n",
    "Investment Decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on model predictions and feature analysis, assess if PG&E is currently underpriced.\n",
    "Combine machine learning insights with traditional financial analysis and industry knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### xStep 7: Continuous Monitoring and Improvement\n",
    "Update Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuously update your models with new data to maintain their accuracy.\n",
    "Implement a pipeline for regular data ingestion, model retraining, and evaluation.\n",
    "Monitor Market Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep an eye on market conditions, regulatory changes, and news events that could impact PG&E’s stock price.\n",
    "By following these steps, you can build a comprehensive machine-learning framework to assess if PG&E is underpriced after the fires it was accused of causing. This approach will help you make informed investment decisions based on data-driven insights.\n",
